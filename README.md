## Relational Database with Duckdb 

Database Schema and Relations:
The code creates four related tables with clear relationships:


games - Stores game information with game_id as primary key
teams - Stores team information with team_id as primary key
game_teams - Junction table linking games and teams with composite primary key (game_id, team_id)
players - Stores player statistics with composite primary key (player_id, game_id)


Relationships between tables:


game_teams has foreign key relationships to both games (game_id) and teams (team_id)
players has foreign key relationships to games (game_id) and teams (team_id)


SQL Operations:
The code uses standard SQL operations:


INSERT OR REPLACE for upserting data
SELECT queries for retrieving statistics
Joins (implied in the database design)
Primary key constraints
Timestamp tracking for data currency


Database Management:

def __init__(self, db_path='nba_live_stats.db'):
    self.conn = duckdb.connect(db_path)

The code establishes and maintains a persistent connection to a DuckDB database file.

ACID Properties:
The code maintains database consistency through:

Transaction management using commit()
Atomic updates using INSERT OR REPLACE
Primary key constraints ensuring data integrity
