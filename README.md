# NBA Live Games Tracker üèÄ

This Streamlit app provides real-time updates and statistics for live NBA games by integrating NBA's live data API. It tracks game scores, player statistics, and team performance while maintaining a local DuckDB database for historical data analysis.

Additionally has predictions for live games ( experimental ) which uses random forest machine learning!

- **Player Statistics**: Detailed stats including minutes played, points, rebounds, assists, shooting percentages, and more.
- **Database Integration**: Uses DuckDB to store and query game, team, and player data.
- **Custom Refresh Rates**: Adjustable refresh interval for real-time updates.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive data tables for exploring historical game data.
- **Database Management**: Tools to reset and view database content directly from the app.
- **Predicting Live games**: Machine learning with Random Forest to predict live nba games. 



## Relational Database with Duckdb 

Database Schema and Relations:
The code creates four related tables with clear relationships:


games - Stores game information with game_id as primary key
teams - Stores team information with team_id as primary key
game_teams - Junction table linking games and teams with composite primary key (game_id, team_id)
players - Stores player statistics with composite primary key (player_id, game_id)


Relationships between tables:


game_teams has foreign key relationships to both games (game_id) and teams (team_id)
players has foreign key relationships to games (game_id) and teams (team_id)


SQL Operations:
The code uses standard SQL operations:


INSERT OR REPLACE for upserting data
SELECT queries for retrieving statistics
Joins (implied in the database design)
Primary key constraints
Timestamp tracking for data currency


Database Management:

def __init__(self, db_path='nba_live_stats.db'):
    self.conn = duckdb.connect(db_path)

The code establishes and maintains a persistent connection to a DuckDB database file.

ACID Properties:
The code maintains database consistency through:

Transaction management using commit()
Atomic updates using INSERT OR REPLACE
Primary key constraints ensuring data integrity


Goals / Tweaks: 

For Database: 
Have not only a database for the live games but also one for historical games.
Include more statistics and possibly advanced ones like VORP or defensive rating. 

For Predictions:

Predictions take a large amount of time beacuse its creating features and using data for many games throughout the season each time a prediction is made.
For a more optimized approach store the existing models and for every new game add that new data for training , this iterative approach can be much more efficient. 
Additionally, better features can be used to train the model such as detailed player statistics/injuries and team statistics for every game rather than a culimative approach using average team stats.

Eventually it updating the odds throughout the match as it is live can be possisble, as well as showing the 'vegas odds' of the match would be a good comparison. 

Overall frontend: 

Possibly adding pictures of players, better layout for games/statistics based on surveyed users.
